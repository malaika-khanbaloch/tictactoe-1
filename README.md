tictactoe in c++
1. Overview


The program is a simple command-line based implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. It allows two players to play the game by taking turns, making moves on a 3x3 grid, and determining the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

3. Class Definition
The core of the program is the TicTacToe class, which encapsulates the game's logic and data. This class has:
- A private 2D array board to store the state of the game.
- A constructor to initialize the game board.
- Methods for displaying the board, validating moves, executing moves, and checking the game status.

3. Game Logic
The game logic involves:
- Displaying the game board to the players.
- Allowing players to input their moves.
- Validating if the moves are valid.
- Updating the board based on player moves.
- Checking if a player has won, if the game is a draw, or if it should continue.

4. Main Function
The main function orchestrates the game by:
- Creating an instance of the TicTacToe class.
- Managing the turn-taking between the two players.
- Continuously checking the game status to determine if there is a winner, if it's a draw, or if the game should continue.
- Displaying the final result of the game once it concludes.
